# Validation workflow

The project uses vertical conformance slices. For every feature:

1. State the governing equation and discrete algorithm.
2. Identify whether legacy behavior is authoritative, merely informative, or
   an apparent defect.
3. Add focused CPU unit tests.
4. Add a small scenario fixture with declared tolerances.
5. Implement Metal and CUDA independently.
6. Run the same fixture on real Apple and NVIDIA hardware.
7. Add scaling and long-run statistical tests only after stage-level parity.

Pull requests must not claim a backend supports a feature when it invokes the
CPU reference or transfers the full state to the host to complete the step.
